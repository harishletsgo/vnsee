# Build guide

_This build guide uses the [Toltec Docker toolchain](https://github.com/toltec-dev/toolchain), which requires a working Docker install._

Start by cloning this repository with its dependencies, then change directory into it.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/matteodelabre/vnsee
cd vnsee
```

Use the following command to spin up a container and run a build in the `build/Release` subdirectory.

```sh
docker container run -it --rm \
    --mount type=bind,src="$(realpath .)",dst=/src \
    ghcr.io/toltec-dev/base:v2.1 \
    bash -c "cmake \
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/share/cmake/arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -S /src -B /src/build/Release \
    && cmake --build /src/build/Release"
```

This command will first run the CMake configuration command, which will automatically locate the appropriate compiler and determine flags.
This step should end with the following lines:

```
...
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /src/build/Release
```

Right after the configuration step has finished, the command will start the actual build.
You should see CMakeâ€™s colorful output logging the files it compiles, with lines similar to this one:

```
...
[ 16%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/vnsee.dir/src/main.cpp.o
...
```

When this step completes, you should have a working `vnsee` executable in the `build/Release` subdirectory, ready to be executed on your reMarkable!
